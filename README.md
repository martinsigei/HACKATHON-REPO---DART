# HACKATHON-REPO---DART

*Dart Program*

**1. Palindrome Checker**
Task: Write a Dart function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. The function should ignore spaces, punctuation, and be case-insensitive.
Bonus Points: Extend the function to check palindrome properties for numeric inputs as well.
Objective: Test string manipulation, logic implementation, and handling edge cases.

**A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. In other words, it's a word, phrase, number, or other sequence that remains unchanged when reversed.**

*Examples*:
Words: "madam", "racecar", "level"
Phrases: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"
Numbers: "12321", "45654" **
 
**2. Sorting Algorithm Implementation**
Task: Write a Dart function that implements a sorting algorithm (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort, or Bubble Sort) to sort a list of integers. The function should return the sorted list.
Bonus Points: Implement two different sorting algorithms and compare their performance in terms of execution time.
Objective: Test understanding of algorithmic complexity and the ability to implement and optimize sorting algorithms.

**A sorting algorithm is a method or process used to arrange elements in a list or array in a specific order. The most common orders are ascending (smallest to largest) or descending (largest to smallest).**

**3. Basic Calculator Function**
Task: Implement a Dart function that takes two numbers and a mathematical operator (+, -, *, /, %) as input and returns the calculated result. The function should handle basic arithmetic operations.
Bonus Points: Extend the function to handle multi-step operations and include error handling for division by zero.
Objective: Evaluate proficiency in conditional statements, arithmetic operations, and error handling.

**Calculator implements a function that performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input. The calculator should handle both valid inputs and errors (such as division by zero).**
